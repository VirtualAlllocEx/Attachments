# Mailfilter and Firewall Check
This are different file types which can be used to check the security level from your mailfilter and your firewall. 

1.) Mailfilter Check
You can use the different file types and send it as an attachment. So you can check which attachments are filtered
by your mailserver and which not 

2.) Firewall Check
For example you can host download this files and then host it for example with the cobalt strike http webserver. 
By hosting the files with http you can check, which file types (MIME types) are filtered by your firewall and which not.
